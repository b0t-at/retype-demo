You can install Retype using `npm`, `yarn`, or the `dotnet` CLI.

From your command line, navigate to a folder location where you have one or more Markdown (.md) files, such as a GitHub project.

Next, choose one of the following tools to first install `retypeapp` and then start Retype by using the `retype start` command:

+++ NPM
```
npm install retypeapp --global
retype start
```
+++ Yarn
```
yarn global add retypeapp
retype start
```

That's it! Your new Retype website should be up and running.
